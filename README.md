# Drum Kit

A simple Drum Kit built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The drums are activated by either keydown events (keyboard presses) or mouse clicks (clicking on drum buttons). It's a fun way to play sounds directly from the keyboard or by clicking on the drum images!

## Features

- Play drums using the keyboard or mouse.
- Different drum sounds for each key or button.
- Stylish design with responsive layout.
- Built using plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For creating the structure of the drum kit, including the drum buttons.
- **CSS**: For styling the drum kit buttons and layout.
- **JavaScript**: For adding interactivity by listening for keydown and click events to trigger the drum sounds.
